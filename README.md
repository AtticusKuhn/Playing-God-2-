# **Game Specification: "Playing God"**

## **1. Overview**
"Playing God" is a god simulation game where the player assumes the role of the Abrahamic God. The player interacts with a simulated world populated by AI-driven individuals, each with unique characteristics, emotions, and life stories. The player can influence the world through divine interventions, respond to prayers, and guide humanity toward salvation. The game aims to provide an immersive experience that explores the complexity of divine decision-making while respecting theological sensitivities.

## **2. Core Gameplay Mechanics**

### **2.1 Time System**
- **Continuous Time**: The game runs in real-time, with 10 minutes of real-world time equating to one in-game year.
- **Time Controls**: The player can pause, slow down, or speed up time to manage events and respond to prayers effectively.
- **Timeline**: The game begins in 2025 and progresses indefinitely. The end of times is not predetermined, allowing for open-ended gameplay.

### **2.2 Simulated Individuals**
Each individual in the game is represented by an AI-driven agent with the following characteristics:

#### **2.2.1 Physical Attributes**
- **Location**: A 2D position on the world map.
- **Age**: Tracks the individual's age over time.
- **Actions**: Individuals can perform actions such as moving, praying, or interacting with others.

#### **2.2.2 Mental Attributes**
- **Emotions**: A dynamic emotional state (e.g., happy, sad, angry) influenced by life events and interactions.
- **Thoughts**: Internal monologues or reflections generated by an AI model.
- **Goals/Desires**: Aspirations such as "I want a new job" or "I want to travel to Paris."

#### **2.2.3 Spiritual Attributes**
- **Faith**: A measure of the individual's belief in God, which can fluctuate over time.
- **Prayers**: Requests or communications directed to God, generated by the AI based on the individual's life circumstances.
- **Afflictions**: Individuals may be influenced by spiritual forces (e.g., demons like Mammon or Belial).

#### **2.2.4 Life Story**
- **Personal Details**: Name, birthday, relationships (e.g., parents, siblings, friends).
- **History**: A log of significant life events, prayers, and decisions.

### **2.3 Divine Interactions**
The player can interact with the world and its inhabitants in the following ways:

#### **2.3.1 Responding to Prayers**
- **Prayer Inbox**: A list of prayers received from individuals.
- **Response Options**: Accept, deny, or delay prayers. Responses can have immediate or long-term consequences.

#### **2.3.2 Divine Actions**
- **Natural Disasters**: Send thunder, fire, meteors, plagues, or pandemics.
- **Blessings**: Grant miracles, heal individuals, or provide material wealth.
- **Smite**: Punish individuals with lightning or other divine retribution.

#### **2.3.3 Observation**
- **Inspect Individuals**: Click on a person to view their life details, including current emotions, thoughts, and prayers.
- **Global View**: Monitor the overall state of the world, including population statistics and major events.

#### **2.3.4 Final Judgment**
- **Heaven or Hell**: Decide the eternal fate of individuals based on their earthly actions and faith. Alternatively, delegate this task to Peter (AI).

## **3. AI Integration**

### **3.1 AI-Driven Individuals**
- **Behavior Model**: Use a local AI model (e.g., LLaMa 3 14b) to simulate individual behavior.
- **Inputs**: Personal details, current location, emotional state, and life history.
- **Outputs**: Actions, thoughts, prayers, and decisions.

### **3.2 Generative Systems**
- **Prayer Generation**: AI generates prayers based on the individual's life circumstances.
- **Thought Generation**: AI simulates internal monologues and reflections.
- **Decision-Making**: AI determines the individual's actions, such as moving to a new location or pursuing a goal.

## **4. World Design**

### **4.1 Map**
- **Mini Map**: A 2D tile-based map representing the world.
- **Tile Providers**: Use OpenStreetMap or similar services for map tiles.
- **Dynamic Movement**: Individuals move across the map based on their goals and actions.

### **4.2 Visuals**
- **Sprites**: Animated sprites for individuals, with walking animations.
- **Events**: Visual effects for divine actions (e.g., lightning strikes, fire).
